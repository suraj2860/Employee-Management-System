# Employee-Management-System
An employee management system (EMS) using Java, Swing, AWT, and OOP (Object-oriented programming) concepts is a software program that enables an organization to manage and organize employee data by providing functionalities to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

The application would be developed using Java as the programming language, which would provide the platform independence and security features. Swing and AWT libraries would be used to create the user interface, which would be a graphical interface for the user to interact with the system. The user interface would be designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate.

The application would be based on OOP concepts, which would allow for the creation of objects that represent employees and their properties, such as their name, address, and salary. These objects would be used to perform CRUD operations on employee data.

The application would have features such as creating new employee records, viewing employee details, updating employee information, and deleting employee records.
